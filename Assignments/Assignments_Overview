Day 1:

Data Visualization using Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a Python plotting library that produces high-quality 
charts and figures, which helps us visualize extensive data to 
understand better. The data is given to you, in the form of list 
in the Jupyter Notebook. Analyze the data and plot the graphs for
the following questions. 

Read Total profit of all months and show it using a line plot 

Read all product sales data and show it  using a multiline plot 

Read toothpaste sales data of each month and show it using a scatter plot 

Read face cream and face-wash product sales data and show it using 
the bar chart. Save this plot to your hard disk 

Calculate total sale data for last year for each product and show
it using a Pie chart


Day 2:

Create Multi Linear Regression Model 

To calculate an individual’s home loan approval limit, we not only need
his age but also his credit rating and other features are also considered
such as age, credit rating, number of children’s, etc. The data set named
‘loan-approval-dataset’ is given to you.  

Implement linear regression with multiple features (also known as 
multiple linear regressions) to predict loan approval limit. 

Day 3:

Create a Logistic Regression model on Azure ML Studio 

The dataset named ‘Breast cancer’ is there in the saved Datasets. Build 
logistic regression model to predict whether patient has cancer or not 
in azure Machine learning studio. Also perform required data preprocessing
activities on dataset, if required.

Day 4:

Create a simple CNN model for Image Classification 

In this exercise, Create a simple CNN-based image classifier for 
images of MNIST dataset. Try to add different filters and pooling 
layers to the CNN network and calculate the overall accuracy of the 
model.
